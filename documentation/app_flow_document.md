# Spediak App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user opens the Spediak app, they are welcomed by a dedicated onboarding screen that directs them to either sign up or log in. The sign-up process emphasizes email and password as the primary method, supported by social login options using Google or Facebook for extra convenience. After entering the necessary credentials, the user receives an email verification to ensure the authenticity of the account before being granted full access. If users already have an account, they can quickly log in from this screen. In the event that a user forgets their password, a simple “Forgot Password” option is available that guides them through a secure recovery workflow, ensuring that account access is promptly restored. Once signed in, users have a clearly marked logout option allowing them to safely end their session when needed.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful authentication, users are directed to the New Inspection screen, which serves as the main dashboard. This screen prominently displays the Spediak brand name in a centered top header, reinforcing the professional and minimal aesthetic of the app. Navigation is exclusively handled through a single Hamburger Menu located in the top-left corner that provides access to all major sections. The core area of the home page features a large image upload box that invites users to either take a photo or choose one from the gallery, accompanied by a camera/gallery icon and instructional text such as “Tap to upload or take a photo.” Below or adjacent to this area, there is a text field prompting users to “Describe the issue...” with an integrated microphone icon on the right, offering native voice-to-text transcription. Two primary buttons are available: one large, centered button labeled “Generate DDID Response,” which becomes active once both an image and description are provided, and a smaller “New Inspection” button below it for restarting the process as needed.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The journey of creating a new inspection starts on the New Inspection screen. Users interact with the image upload section which, based on the device, launches a modal offering options to either choose an image from the gallery or capture a new photo for mobile users, while desktop users experience a direct file picker. Regardless of the method, a thumbnail is displayed once the image is secured, providing immediate feedback. Simultaneously, users enter a description either by typing directly into the input field or by tapping the built-in microphone icon to utilize the device’s native voice-to-text capabilities. After the input has been provided, the “Generate DDID Response” button becomes enabled and, upon being pressed, triggers an API call to the AI backend powered by Open AI. As the system processes the data, a circular spinner appears near the button, indicating progress and temporarily disabling further interactions. When the AI returns a result, a modal pop-up comes into view displaying the generated DDID statement in plain text along with readily accessible options such as a Copy button positioned at the top right and a Close button at the top left for dismissing the modal. In cases where fields are filled and the user taps on the “New Inspection” button, a confirmation pop-up is shown to ensure that the user intends to clear the current data and begin a new process. Users wishing to review past inspections can navigate via the Hamburger Menu to the Inspection History screen. Here, a clean, scrollable list displays each previously generated report with a thumbnail, a short snippet of both the description and the generated DDID statement, and a clear timestamp. Tapping on any record expands it to reveal the complete DDID content with an option to copy the text. In addition, the Profile Settings screen is reachable through the same Hamburger Menu, offering users the chance to update details such as full name, password, and state selection, which in turn affects the formatting of future DDID statements. The navigation between these pages is seamless, ensuring that every transition—from generating a new report to reviewing inspection history or adjusting account settings—is integrated through the single Hamburger Menu interface.

## Settings and Account Management

Users manage their personal information and account preferences from the Profile Settings screen. In this area, users can update editable fields such as their full name, password, and a mandated state selection, which is limited to North Carolina or South Carolina. This state selection directly influences the structure, legal references, and codes applied to the DDID statements generated for future inspections. Information like the email address is shown in a view-only manner, ensuring that it remains secure, yet it can be updated later if provided for by administrative controls. Additionally, users have the opportunity to add or change a profile picture with a designated area that falls back to a default avatar when no picture is set. Once changes are saved, users can easily return to the main app flow by accessing the Hamburger Menu to navigate to any other section of the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users attempt to sign up with invalid details or fail during the login process, the app promptly displays clear error messages, guiding them to correct the mistakes. When generating a DDID statement, if the backend takes longer than expected or fails to respond due to connectivity issues, a loading spinner is activated near the generate button and the screen is temporarily disabled to prevent further input. Should an error occur during the DDID generation, a descriptive error message is shown, such as "There was a problem generating the DDID response. Please check your connection and try again," accompanied by a retry option that allows the user to initiate the request again. Similarly, error messages appear if the user uploads an image in an unsupported format or exceeds the file size limit, ensuring that each alternative path is addressed with clear guidance so the user can regain a normal flow of interaction quickly.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The Spediak app offers a streamlined and intuitive experience that guides the user from the onboarding phase through to everyday usage. Beginning with precise sign-up and sign-in processes that incorporate email verification and social logins, the user is immediately placed into the New Inspection workflow upon authentication. With a clean, mobile-first design and a strict reliance on a single Hamburger Menu for navigation, users are encouraged to upload defect images, provide detailed descriptions (with supportive voice-to-text functionality), and generate standardized DDID statements with minimal effort. Past inspections are easily accessible on a separate Inspection History page that updates in real time, and Profile Settings empower users to manage their account details while ensuring that legal and state-specific requirements are integrated seamlessly into the report generation process. Every page and feature is connected by a thoughtful flow that emphasizes minimalism, security, and ease of use, culminating in an overall experience that supports home inspectors in efficiently completing their assessments and reports.
