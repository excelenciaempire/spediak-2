# Spediak App Tech Stack Document

This document outlines the technology choices made for the Spediak App, a professional tool designed for home inspectors. The goal is to create a clean, fast, and secure experience while keeping the interface minimal and mobile-first. Below is a detailed explanation of the various technology components and why they were chosen.

## Frontend Technologies

The Spediak App uses modern frontend technologies to deliver a responsive and user-friendly interface. Key components include:

- **React**: Used for building the web interface. It allows us to create interactive UI components that update dynamically without reloading the page.
- **React Native**: Powers the iOS and Android mobile applications, ensuring a native-like experience on both platforms while using a unified codebase.
- **Expo**: Streamlines development and deployment across mobile and web platforms. It simplifies testing, debugging, and building apps for multiple platforms.
- **Styling and Design Tools**:
  - Use of clean, modern fonts (such as Inter, Roboto, or SF Pro) enhances readability and visual appeal.
  - Consistent color palette (Deep Blue, Light Gray, Dark Text) and plenty of whitespace create a minimalistic design that is easy on the eyes.
  - Rounded corners for images, buttons, and modals contribute to a polished and modern look.

These frontend choices ensure that all users enjoy a consistent, intuitive, and accessible experience, whether they're on mobile or desktop.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of Spediak is designed to handle business logic, data management, and AI integration securely and efficiently. The stack includes:

- **Node.js (v18+)**: A robust JavaScript runtime for server-side code, enabling us to write both client and server logic in the same language.
- **Express.js**: A web framework that simplifies building APIs and handling server requests, ensuring our backend is clean and maintainable.
- **Supabase**:
  - Acts as the primary database and file storage service.
  - Stores user data, inspection reports, and uploaded images in a secure and scalable environment.
  - Ensures that images (JPEG and PNG up to 5MB) are correctly managed.
- **OpenAI Integration**:
  - Used for generating DDID responses by analyzing defect images and text descriptions.
  - The app sends images and descriptions via API calls, and the response helps generate a standardized DDID statement that meets state-specific criteria.

Together, these backend components work in harmony to handle user data securely while providing real-time, AI-powered report generation.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To ensure reliability, scalability, and ease of deployment, the following infrastructure components have been chosen:

- **Hosting and Deployment**:
  - The app is deployed via Expo, making it available on iOS, Android, and web platforms.
  - Expo’s build tools simplify packaging and publishing updates to app stores.
- **Version Control and CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - Source code is managed with Git, ensuring that code changes are tracked and can be reverted if necessary.
  - CI/CD tools help automate testing and deployment, ensuring the app remains stable through continuous integration.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Sensitive information (like API keys) is managed using environment variables, boosting security by preventing key exposure.

These infrastructure decisions mean that developers can roll out updates quickly while keeping the app stable and secure.

## Third-Party Integrations

Spediak leverages several third-party services to enhance its functionality and streamline development:

- **OpenAI API**:
  - Used to generate the DDID responses based on image and text inputs.
  - Provides a powerful tool for natural language processing, enabling dynamic report generation.
- **Supabase**:
  - Serves as both the database and storage solution.
  - Offers a unified platform to manage inspection records and media files securely.

Integrating these services allows the app to out-of-the-box use advanced functionalities while maintaining a lean internal codebase.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are paramount in the Spediak App. Here’s how they have been addressed:

- **Security Measures**:
  - **User Authentication**: Features a dedicated sign-up and login process, with email verification and optional social login (Google or Facebook). User sessions are managed using secure methods such as JWT.
  - **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and sensitive data, like passwords, is stored securely with salted hashing techniques.
  - **API Key Management**: Sensitive keys (OpenAI API and Supabase) are managed via environment variables. Additional backend restrictions ensure that these keys are not exposed.
  - **Access Control**: Use of strict permission controls to ensure users have access only to their own data.

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensures smooth performance on various devices, with real-time updates on the Inspection History screen.
  - **Loading Indicators**: Use of spinners during AI calls provides users with feedback, preventing multiple submissions and improving overall experience.
  - **Asset Management**: Efficient image storage and processing ensure minimal delay and resource usage.

These measures guarantee that the app not only delivers a smooth user experience but also protects user data from unauthorized access.
